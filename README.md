When traveling it is useful to check weather conditions in cities or towns that you are looking to visit.
This enables you to make a decision on whether or not to travel, the type of clothing you may want to wear and the equipment you may need.  This would enable any traveler to plan their trip around this information.

I created a dashboard that would enable anybody whether they were traveling or not to view up-to-date weather forecast.  I have also included a feature which enables the user to view the weather conditions for five days.  

The dash board includes UV and humidty readings, it also includes wind speed for the current day so the user can plan accordingly.

One element to design this dashboard was to obtain an API key from https://openweathermap.org/api, so that I could ensure the end user could have the most up-to-date information required.

The assignment was my first experience of working Cross-Origin resource sharing (CORS).
